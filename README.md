# Fire & Smoke Detection using Azure Custom Vision ðŸ”¥

## Overview  
This project demonstrates the development of an AI model for detecting fire and smoke using Azure Custom Vision. With early detection being critical for safety, this system is designed to classify images as either containing fire, smoke, or neutral conditions with impressive accuracy.  

---

## Key Features  
- **Model Training**: Used Azure Custom Vision for training the model with real-world fire and smoke images.  
- **High Accuracy**: Achieved 100% precision, recall, and AP across all tags (fire, smoke, and neutral).  
- **Classification**: The system can identify and differentiate between fire, smoke, and neutral conditions for improved decision-making in safety systems.
